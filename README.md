# TeamPoc
one of A4 project on Embedded Systems 
This depository is to make access of our code's files to run the Greenhouse project in Embedded Systems course.
Some of them are adressed to the Raspberry Pi, and some others are to the Arduino Yun.
Those codes are to be used with sensors applicated to our Greenhouse.

Prerequisites
You need an Arduino yun and Raspberry Pi board to run these files correctly.
The sensors eeded as sensors are: DHT11 and an LDR

Installing
You have to install respectively into the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino:
- Apache, PHP, mysql, ...         Packages latest versions 
- DHT 11 libraries latest versions

Acknowledgments
We got inspired through several websites to run our project such as:
